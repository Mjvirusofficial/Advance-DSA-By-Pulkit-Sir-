################### Linked List #######################

Linked list is an linear data structure where series of 
Node conected to each other.

Here, Each node stored the data and address of the next
node.

Node is an important part of a linked list, its devided
into two part first where we can stored the data and 
second where we stored the address of the next node. 

There are three types of linked list:-
1.Singly Linked List
2.Doubly Linked List
3.Circular Linked List

1.Singly Linked List:-
Singly linked list is a simple linked list where  we 
stored the data in first part of the node and in the 
second part we stored the address of the next node.

2.Doubly Linked List:-
Doubly linked list have a extra part also in node that 
is known as privious part, in which navigation is possible in both ways either forward and backward eisly as compared to single linkedlist.
